1. Pulling wrong DB container image:
   - Maven build tests were failing. In the docker-compose.yml file, i was pulling the mysql:8.3.0 image
   - The testcontainer library created the testcontainers config file which returned the mysql:latest image, which created a conflict
   - Fixed by changing the image name to mysql:8.3.0

2. Flyway migration not working:
   - Flyway migration files (V1__init.sql) should only be run once. Whenever i started the application, it would fail, because the flyway_schema_history table was already created.
   - Fixed by dropping the flyway_schema_history table in mysql workbench.

3. Port already in use:
   - Both order-service and inventory-service use mysql docker containers and they were using the same port 3306:3306
   - This caused the application to fail to start.
   - Fixed by changing the port to 3307 and 3308 for the services respectively, since 3306 is used by mySQL server.
   - Also, I had to make new connections for each port in mySQL workbench for each service, since they were listening on different ports.
   - Need to learn networking/os/dbms in depth. Very helpful in understanding Docker & Kubernetes.
